This repository contains the entire API surface for (Ceres)[https://github.com/ceres-wc3/ceres], expressed in terms of a TypeScript declaration file.

If you're using TypeScript, you can depend on this package:
`npm add ceres-decl`

If you're not using TypeScript, you can still use the file as a reference when developing in pure Lua.
